## What is Nocturnal?

Nocturnal is my turn on a Twitch.tv stream overlay that's aimed towards coding streams. The kind of stream I regularly stream on Twitch.tv on my channel [mrbandler42](https://www.twitch.tv/mrbandler42). If you have any questions you want to ask me in person please stop by.

## State of Development

<p class="callout warning">The project is currently in concept phase, all code that's already written is subject to change.</p>

To use this, please come back at a later time. But leave a star if you are interested.
